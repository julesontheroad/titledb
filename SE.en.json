        "description": "\"Deemo\" is a simple rhythm game set in a fantasy world filled with beautiful imagery.\n\nTouch the \"notes\" that stream toward the screen in time with the music.\nThe system is easy to understand, and players are able to enjoy gameplay which resembles playing a piano.\n\nThere are over 200 pieces of music to choose from, with difficulty levels of EASY, NORMAL, and HARD.\nSuitable for rhythm game beginners and experienced players who need more of a challenge.\n\nMusic is created mostly by Taiwanese and Japanese composers, with a diverse selection of vocal and instrumental songs spanning a wide range of genres.\n\n[The Story]\nDeemo is a mysterious being who lives alone in a castle, playing the piano to itself.\nOne day, a little girl with no memory falls from the sky, breaking his solitude.\n\nDeemo feels compelled to help her get home to her world. \nWhile looking for a way to return her to the sky, Deemo notices a small sapling which grows the more music is played.\nIf Deemo is able to make it grow into a tree, tall enough so it would reach the window in the ceiling, she may just be able to get home.\n\nAs the two interact, Deemo learns what it means to have a friend.\nWhat awaits the two when the little girl regains her memory?\nThis is a slightly strange, touching tale.",

        "intro": "Banging beats and mad style, Lethal League Blaze is the most intense ball game you can play online with up to 4 players.",
        "description": "Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit. In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. \n\nIn the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!\n\nUp to 4 players:\nPlay locally AND online with up to 4 players.\n\nEasy to pick up, hard to master gameplay:\nStart off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. \n\nTons of unlockable extras and secrets:\nUnlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. \n\nPlay on your own:\nStep up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.\n\nModes and options:\nPick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley... \n\nWicked Tracks:\nA Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.\n\nLethal League Blaze is the sequel to the popular projectile-fighting game Lethal League known for it's ridiculous speeds and hitstun, the original game was intense to watch and intenser to play. This time around there will be double the characters at launch and more to come after.",

With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe.

Additional controller required. (Online co-op to be added in the future)\n- emotional tale focused on a family of heroes\n- a diverse set of skills\n- passive and active items modifying each run\n- multiple dungeons set in different biomes\n- a rich world full of history and magic",

        "intro": "Create your hero, lead your team, and save the world in this exciting new turn-based strategy",
        "description": "Prepare for a story-driven campaign within the Sentinel Comics universe as you join forces with an ever-growing team of heroes to face a wide variety of villains. What seems like a typical bank heist reveals itself to be just the beginning of a much more sinister plan! Create your hero, gather your team, and save the world in this exciting new turn-based strategy!\n\nHighlights\n\u25cf Build Your Team - select from the many available heroes and unlock more throughout\n\u25cf Full Story Campaign - writers and creators from Sentinel Comics\n\u25cf Freeform Movement - Turn-based game that allows you to move anywhere\n\u25cf Squad Dynamics - heroes or villains can work together for more powerful actions\n\u25cf Massive Mission Variety - multiple objectives, interactions and dangers\n\u25cf Create Your Hero - choose backstory, archetype, powers, and appearance\n\nWhat kind of hero will you be? \n\nSentinels of Freedom will feature Chapter 1 - as a self contained story - on release with many levels, new heroes and villains, along with hero upgrades.  Chapter 2 will release shortly after in 2020 with other chapters planned to follow.\n\nCustom Heroes\nChoose the character's backstory, personality, power source, abilities and costume. Heroes have \"stances\" that provide boosts to certain stats like extra movement along with powerful sets of abilities and can be fully customized to fit your play style.\n\nBuild your hero from 12 exciting themes - fill your stances with powerful abilities from any three:\n\u25cf Power Melee - When you really want to hit someone really hard.\n\u25cf Combos - Concentrate your attacks, spread 'em out, or bring a friend!\n\u25cf Supportive - Whether protecting or attacking, the right move requires no planning.\n\u25cf Blaster - Attack as many as you can in several different areas!\n\u25cf Interceptor - Never let an enemy out of your sights and punish wrong moves.\n\u25cf Minions - Disposable and endless, have your own minions fight for you!\n\u25cf Gadgets - Deploy an arsenal of gadgets that eliminate all who oppose you.\n\u25cf And more!\n\nCreating a superhero identity is more than a costume selection! Choose how your hero uses their abilities, different weapons, attack styles, and special effects; some themes even have different types of units that you can summon. Refine your heroic identity throughout the game - changing everything about how your hero looks, all the way down to your hero's body type, between any mission.\n\nSync and Vigilance Actions\nSync and Vigilance actions add life to the battlefield when characters perform additional actions out of sequence, triggered by special conditions. When a character performs an action, sync actions allow other characters to take part or enhance that action, like a character creating a distraction to remove the target's Evade defense before an attack lands. Positioning your team to take advantage of these extra actions can be critical to the success of a mission.\n\nVigilance allows an inactive character to react to the active character based on various triggers, such as moving through their line of sight. Each character has a \"vigilance zone\" around them which sets the chance of the vigilance action happening. These actions can go much further than the standard overwatch with actions like \"keep cover\" which allows a character to try and find new cover when flanked.\n\nLarge Scale Missions\nPlayers will embark on several missions throughout the campaign. These missions are broken up into groups of engagements - each offering unique objectives, enemy types and player choice on where to go next - keeping each feeling fresh and unique. Another benefit to these smaller engagements is that the player will not be overwhelmed by both the quantity of enemies and time for each turn. However, stringing all these engagements together still allows the player to feel like their heroes are very powerful as they dispatch lots of enemies throughout the mission.",

        "description": "Clan N is a beat'em up game which combines the classic arcades gameplay with today's modern brawlers. With a fast paced nature, you have to dodge, block and use your light, heavy and special attacks wisely to progress. With an ancient far east theme, you'll get challenged across 7 different levels with many different enemies, Mid/End level bosses and casual mini games integrated into main gameplay.\n\nAbout Clan N:\n\nClan N is an ancient samurai group in the region of \u201cFar East\u201d, sworn to protect the realm from all who seek its destruction. The four group members consist of the shinobigatana-wielding ninja Akira, the staff-striking Reina, the dual sword-swinging Daiki, and the sickle-slashing monk Tarou.\n\nAfter years of training and dedication to their respective craft, each character has uncovered their own unique magical abilities. Akira shoots pulse-filled lightning bolts, Reina controls the ground with vicious earthquake shocks, Daiki swirls up brutal tornado waves, and Tarou can call for the help of Dragons.\n\nStory:\n\nAkuji is a former samurai of the Clan N that discovered the balance of the world lies in three areas: Peace, Knowledge, and Time. Akuji found that if you knock the world of one of these, you can harness the powers of \u201cspiritual imbalance\u201d and grow stronger from it. As a result of pursuing spiritual imbalance, he was shunned from the samurai temple and kicked out of Clan N.\n\nWhat Akuji didn\u2019t know was that attaining spiritual imbalance would not only give you dark powers, it consumed your light and the purity of your life. Following his banishment from the temple and Clan N, Akuji was able to destroy peace by slaughtering villages and retain the power of those he killed, thus absorbing conflict and electric sorcery abilities, becoming the most powerful sorcerer warrior in the Far East. While he continued to grow, Akuji formed Seishin Gun, the spirit group, to join his conquest and remove anyone standing in their path.\n\nOnce his actions were discovered by Clan N, they set on a journey to stop the villainous pillaging by Akuji and Seishin Gun.\n\nAbout the Characters:\n\nReina and Daiki grew as siblings in a southern samurai clan. Reina was not taught the teaching of the clan like her brother Daiki but still observed and learned the ways mastering the staff. She eventually took onto Shamanism as well becoming one of the first shinobi shamans in the land as a young woman.\n\nAkira was a childhood friend adopted into the clan as a lost child wandering in the outer lands chased by a pack of wolves, barely making it to the village. Daiki\u2019s father took the child in and raised them, although Akira typically covers himself from head to after severe scarring.\n\nTarou was from the same monastery as Akuji (prior to his joining of Clan N) and learned under the same teachers. Akuji returned to the Monk\u2019s temple many years later and stole an ancient scroll that explained how to destroy the pillars of balance and extract their spiritual imbalance. In pursuit of Akuji, Tarou traced his steps to Clan N. After explaining the situation to the existing three members, they all decided to team up and take down Akuji.",

        "description": "Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.\n\nThe challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.\n\nWhat\u2019s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\u2019ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.\n\nThey don\u2019t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\u2019ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\u2019t happen but marketing text is hard to write.",

When a dead man awakens with only the memory of a figure in black, he sets into motion a chain of events that have truly mythic consequences.\n\nStep into the boots of the dead man William Mason (voiced by Ron Perlman) and descend into the grim and gritty world of Purgatory in this fast-paced cover shooter which combines the fluidity of twin-stick controls and tactical cover usage. Put your skills to the test - Dodge behind cover as you try to outgun your enemies in the unknown procedurally generated hunting grounds. The Wild West has never been this dark. ",

        "description": "Years ago, Earth was jeopardized by a Kaiju invasion. Faced with insurmountable odds, our best known scientists and world leaders floundered and it seemed everything was lost. That is, until the mysterious Dr. V revealed his new technology - the Voltas. Thanks to the Voltas and their pilots, our victory over the alien threat was swift and decisive. After overcoming the Kaiju, these formidable robots provided the foundation for the most popular sport in the world \u2013 Volta battling!\n\nNow we\u2019re extending an invitation to you to join the World Volta Association, the premiere destination for high stakes Volta combat. Achieving prestige and fame will take teamwork and plenty of strategy. Prove your championship drive by commanding your crew members to power up weapons, dodge attacks, or repair your Volta while you simultaneously attack your opponent\u2019s Volta to weaken them and gain victory! As you rise through our ranks, you\u2019ll earn access to more Voltas, obtain incredible weapons, and face even tougher challenges.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not in the arena, you\u2019ll have full access to your own custom headquarters, too. There, you\u2019ll be able to develop the perfect balance of work and play between your team, Voltas, and gear. It\u2019s important because while the WVA is currently a place where we fight for sport, there may be a time again when Voltas will be on the frontlines to protect our planet from any dangers that dare threaten us.\n\nPERSONALIZE THE PERFECT LOADOUT\nEach Volta starts with a similar foundation, but more complicated weaponry adds nearly endless depth and customization options for winning pilots. There\u2019s nothing more satisfying than creating your perfectly balanced loadout and taking on opponents in highly competitive strategic battles!\n\nYOUR PILOT\u2019S JOURNEY\nOur pilots all had a path that led them to piloting a Volta. Through a single-player campaign, your pilot will qualify for the league and fight tooth and nail to climb the championship ranks. Along the way, pilots may even discover some dramatic secrets about themselves and their world.\n\nMANAGE YOUR TEAM\u2019S BASE\nThe fight itself is only half the battle. Preparation is key, and pilots must be well rested and continually researching ways to level up their arsenal. Take full control of your headquarters to keep your team focused for battle and on the cutting edge of powerful Volta tech. \n\nMAKE YOUR MARK ON THE WORLD\nConnect with other players in Clans to share strategies and fight each other, keeping your skills sharp. Engage in PVP battles and special Events against the whole world. Only then can pilots prove their mettle by getting to the top of the global leaderboard and making a name for themselves in the World Volta Association!",

Be careful, however, of what could possibly lurk in the air vents. If anything should catch your attention, turn your flashlight straight into the vent to repel it, Fazbear Entertainment supplies batteries free of charge to all of its franchisees!\n\nThe next day, assuming you have survived during the night, reinvest your income from yesterday in new equipment. Develop your little pizzeria, day after day, to see it become an empire of catering and entertainment! Fazbear Entertainment provides its franchisees with all the tools and knowledge necessary to create and manage a welcoming, secure and profitable location.\n\nOh and if you feel up to it, try to salvage some of the animatronics that wander outside your restaurant. They are trying to get in for months now, better not miss on the opportunity to pick up spare parts and rake in some additional revenue. If you detect any instability or aggressiveness in any of them, use the self-defense taser that Fazbear Entertainment provides free of charge to all of its franchisees.\n\nThis puts an end to the assistance that we are legally obligated to provide. Fazbear Entertainment cannot be held responsible for the disappearances, deaths or mutilations that may occur as a result of operating the Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria franchise.\n\nDon't wait any longer and start today!",

Fly too far into enemy territory and there may be a price to pay.\n\nChoose between three different modes to achieve your goals: fighter plane, ground battle, and transportation.  Travel faster and transport units to other bases with fighter plane mode.  Manage energy usage and do more damage, by switching to the grounded, robot form. \n\n\nPlay against AI or friends via the online multiplayer mode only available in the SEGA AGES version of Herzog Zwei.  If jumping into a game sounds too intimidating, try out practice mode, a robust robot tutorial.  With save states and replays as well, this game is perfect for newcomers and Herzog Zwei veterans alike.",

Choose your version from ARCADE (true to the original arcade game), NOVICE (better if this is your first step into the world of hardcore shmuppage), or ARRANGED (a whole new can of worms with unique mechanics and novel challenges never seen before in the Crimzon Clover saga), then choose your mode from Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.\n\nOriginal is THE main mode, where you blast your way through stages in search of the last boss. Boost Mode will adjust the difficulty based on how proficient you are at devastating your enemies. Unlimited turns each stage into an intense battlefield of bullets that only the most hardcore players will be able to survive. And Time Attack pits you against the clock as you race to earn the best score possible in about 3 minutes.\n\nCan you pilot your craft through the bullet massacre the enemies have prepared for you? Or will your ship become just another bump amidst the endless wreckage beneath your wings?",

        "description": "REZ PLZ is a pixel art puzzle platformer with a new twist on co-op and single player gameplay: Kill your brother to solve puzzles and conquer dungeons. Join apprentice wizard brothers Arcan and Zeph as they fight the forces of Dark Arcanum armed with little more than the Resurrection Scroll, a tool they can use to bring each other back to life. As you progress, you will unlock new spells that grant diverse abilities to conquer the increasingly difficult challenges ahead.\n\nCO-OP PLAY\nREZ PLZ puts a unique spin on the traditional co-op concept. Instead of trying to keep each player alive through each level, you must strategically kill each other to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Use the Resurrection Scroll to bring Arcan and Zeph back to life.\n\nDEATH AROUND EVERY CORNER\nDeath is everywhere in REZ PLZ, and can come from a multitude of one-hit deaths, ranging from being sliced in half, eaten by creatures, burned alive and more.\n\nUNLOCK MAGICAL SPELLS\nUnlock new spells to conquer the increasingly difficult challenges ahead, but be careful because these brothers are poor at magic and one bad spell can mean death!\n\nUNLOCKABLES\nExplore and find a bevy of unlockable cosmetic items and unlockable challenging gauntlet levels to customize your gameplay. Challenge yourself further with bonus modes such as PVP foot race. \n\nSTORY\nREZ PLZ tells the story of Arcan and Zeph, two young apprentice wizards. When their school is overrun by evil forces, the duo has to work together to defeat the evil wizards of Dark Arcanum. The catch: They\u2019re both terrible at magic. Although Arcan and Zeph learn spells along the way, their progress is slow. When they die, the Resurrection Scroll brings them back to life.\n",

        "description": "How would you feel if you broke your leg in a scrab trap, were abducted by soulless scientists, had an alien device implanted in your skull, and found out your race had been hunted to extinction?\n\nIt's up to you to help guide Munch in efforts to rescue fellow test creatures. These critters will be forever loyal to Munch and in turn enable his escape . Once free, Munch teams up with Abe and together they are guided by the wisdom of the Almighty Raisin. They are informed as to how to accomplish their goals, but in order to do so, they must work together. For Munch, his dream is to bring back his species from the brink of extinction. For Abe, it is to rescue his Mudokon buddies.\n\nUsing special powers, cool power-ups, and other special abilities to deliver payback to the Vykkers, Abe and Munch reclaim the last gabbit eggs on Oddworld, which have been packaged in a can of gabbiar. May Odd help you!",

What's more, there seems to be an eerie presence that's watching all of this from the shadows.  After groping around for clues, MO gradually becomes aware that it is responsible for a mission of immense importance.

Our heroes will board the Bastion with one goal in mind: uncover the secrets behind the cataclysm, stop the Boss, and bring balance back to the Metaverse.\n\nHarness the power of space-time abilities - death becomes a minor setback as our heroes will return again and again until this great evil is defeated. But death has a cost; the chaotic nature of the Metaverse will change the very Bastion itself, and no two attempts will ever be the same.\n\nWith so many weapons, enemies and environments to discover, the quest to save the Metaverse is better than ever on Nintendo Switch\u2122!",

        "description": "As a police detective tasked with bringing down a dangerous terrorist group, you fight on two fronts: interrogating suspects & managing your team and its reputation. With time running out, how far will you go to stop these criminals? Manipulation, threats or even torture? Does the end justify the means?\n\n- Explore deep and increasingly difficult conversational puzzles to get to the bottom of a terrifying conspiracy\n- Show your management skills balancing your cases, team, budget and the police force\u2019s relationship with the public\n- Reach one of multiple world-defining endings - where will your choices lead you?\n- Meet over 35 complex and realistic characters\n- Immerse yourself in the expressive noir art based on real actor footage and atmospheric music\n\nGameplay\nIn the pursuit of terrorist organization The Liberation Front, you have to coordinate your team to gather information, manage your limited budget and deal with the press hot on your heels for a good story. But that is only half of it:\nYour main task as lead investigator is interrogating suspects. Understanding their backgrounds, and thus their motivations, is key in choosing whether intimidation, guile or empathy is the right approach. There is no universal solution \u2013 but the clock is ticking relentlessly. \nAs you\u2019re closing in on the true culprits and your suspects are getting more resistant, the interrogations become increasingly difficult. Uncover the truth through complex conversations, psychological manipulation and other techniques. \nThe Liberation Front will not be easily dismantled.\n\nThe game\u2019s goal\nInterrogation: You will be deceived is a narratively immersive convo-puzzle game that challenges common preconceptions about highly relevant contemporary subjects like terrorism, police brutality and the power imbalances between citizens, the state and large corporations. The game tries to raise important moral, ideological and practical questions in the minds of the players.",

        "description": "John Wick Hex is a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game that makes you think and strike like John Wick, the professional hitman of the critically acclaimed film franchise. Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series\u2019 signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences.\n\nFeaturing a unique blend of strategic time-based action, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you\u2019ll use and the manner in which you\u2019ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.\n\nExperience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'. John Wick Hex compliments the style of the films with a unique graphic noir art design and an original score by renowned composer Austin Wintory.",

        "description": "Build a loyal band of followers and survive the journey across a broken world. Barely.\n\nTake on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. \n\nYou are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?\n\n- Card-based tactical combat system\n- New procedurally generated maps each game\n- Find loot and recruit followers to build your deck \n- Unlock new content across multiple playthroughs\n- More than 300 cards for you to discover\n- Indian infused electronica soundtrack\n\nNowhere Prophet is a single-player card game with procedurally generated maps, high difficulty and permadeath. At its heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.\n\nDuring travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. \n\nIf you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.\n\nYou will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. \n\nPlay convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.\n\nNowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.\n\nIn this world inspired by Indian culture, you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance, they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. \n\nIf you can survive long enough to find it.",

Venture forth as Sister Semilla to burn down the pillars of heresy in Minoria, an action-platformer by the creators of Momodora.\n\nThe story takes place during the fourth Witch War. It is a time of fanatical religious fervor. The Sacred Office, a powerful organization leading an Inquisition against heresy, purges the sinners who threaten humanity. Those responsible for conducting a mysterious ceremony that contradicts the rules of the Church are labeled \u201cwitches.\u201d Now, Sisters Semilla and Fran, missionaries in the Church\u2019s service, set out to thwart the witches\u2019 ceremony and protect the common-folk from heresy that endangers the status quo.\n\nMinoria is the latest and most ambitious game from Bombservice and a spiritual sequel to the Momodora series. Fans of Momodora will find familiar aspects in the design and gameplay elements, as they master the ins-and-outs of parries, dodges, and a variety of different spells. Now in HD format, with aesthetics mixing 2D hand-painted backgrounds and cel-shaded characters, Minoria continues Bombservice\u2019s legacy on consoles.\n\n\u30fbA powerful fantasy story inspired by the history of medieval Europe\n\n\u30fbA unique visual aesthetic combining hand-painted 2D art with cel-shading\n\n\u30fbFluid controls encouraging careful engagement and patient play\n\n\u30fbCombat enabling players to crush enemies with a mix of swordplay and spells\n\n\u30fbDefensive options including dodge-rolls and parries\n\n\u30fbA leveling system that helps players adjust to their desired difficulty\n",

        "intro": "Raji: An Ancient Epic is an action-adventure game set in ancient India. A young girl named Raji has been chosen by the gods to stand against the demonic invasion of the human realm.",
        "description": "The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic begins with the start of a new war between the demons and the gods. Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.\nThinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.\nAmidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race. \n\nA Story of Siblings\nExperience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.\nRaji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.\n\nStunning Artwork\nInspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!\nEvery corner of the game\u2019s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.\n\nTactical Combat\nDiverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next.\n\nA Universe Set in Ancient India\nFor the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored.\nFrom enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.",

This is the crime to end all crimes.\n\nWhat are the facts? What are the truths? Are they the same?\n\nFACT AND TRUTH ARE NOT THE SAME\nThe \u201ctruth\u201d is that there are many possible killers, and many ways to build a case. Even if you make a convincing case for prosecution and get someone convicted, is the mystery really solved?\n\nEXPLORE AN ISLAND FULL OF SECRETS\nParadise is an island set in an alternate future history filled with cryptic lore and even more mysteries. Examine bizarre relics to learn more about this world\u2019s surreal history.\n\nFIND YOUR PARADISE\nYou choose who to accuse, and build a case to support conviction. Everyone on Paradise has a secret to hide and something to gain. Old friends become new suspects, forcing you to choose between the evidence, the greater good and your own beliefs. There are many possible murderers, but who you pick will define your own personal truth.\n\nGATHER EVIDENCE\nLet your personal computer and electronic assistant Starlight be your guide through another dance of an investigation. Collect evidence, record testimony and interpret the facts to form your own truth.\n\nUNLOCK HIDDEN AREAS\nSolve hieroglyph puzzles on ancient nightmare computers to discover new areas of the island, find concealed evidence and reveal terrifying secrets.",

        "description": "MEET THE CHICKEN POLICE\nSonny Featherland and Marty MacChicken were once a legendary detective-duo, called the Chicken Police. But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before!\n\nNARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY\nChicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them!\n\nEXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...)\nThere are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants.\n\nA CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE\nChicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!\nChicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film-noir twist\n- Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!\n- A carefully crafted, \"colorful\" world\n- A complex interrogation system\n- More than 30 unique, fully voiced characters\n- A cinematic film-noir like experience with more than 20 cutscenes!\n- Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find\n- A beautiful original soundtrack",

        "description": "I Am Dead is a charming puzzle adventure game from the creators of Hohokum and Wilmot\u2019s Warehouse about exploring the afterlife.\n\nMorris Lupton is the recently-deceased museum curator of the tiny island of Shelmerston who is reunited with the ghost of his dog Sparky, only to discover that a disaster is about to destroy his beloved island.\n\nTogether, they must uncover Shelmerston\u2019s ancient mysteries, prevent the island\u2019s volcano from erupting, and save the place they call home.\n\nMorris and Sparky must unearth a number of Shelmerston's lost and scattered ghosts. To find them, the duo must visit the places they spent time in, dive inside the memories of the people who knew them best, and learn the stories of their lives. \n\nTo help with their mission, Morris uses his newfound power that allows him to peer inside objects and people to reveal their contents and memories, like a supernatural X-Ray!\n\nAlong the way you will discover many stories about the history and folklore of Shelmerston, and its cast of curious inhabitants and visitors: tourist finches, the fishfolk, morlos, and the Legend of Aggi - the one who originally silenced the volcano...",

        "description": "Berlin, January 1933. \u201cAdolf Hitler is chancellor!\u201d We all know where that message will lead to, unspeakable horrors and suffering will come to the world. Too few are standing up against the monstrosity of the German Reich. Will you? Lead an underground resistance group Through the Darkest of Times. \n\nIn this strategy game, based on historical events, you plan the actions of your fighters. But what can you do? Fight? A whole army, a whole nation against your group of five. So you have to act carefully and win the hearts and minds of the people, gather more followers, gain more support. \nAnd most important: stay alive. You are always in grave danger, if the Gestapo (Germany\u2019s Secret Service Police during the Third Reich) finds out what you are doing, you might end up in prison or worse. \n\nPlan. Act. Survive. \n\nThrough the Darkest of Times is a turn-based gaming-experience. You assign your comrades on important tasks: Produce leaflets or write messages on walls to inform the people what the Nazis are up to. Gather intel about Nazi-Operations and make them public. Sabotage. The bolder you are, the higher the risk \u2013 but you want to change something, right? Divided into 4 Chapters, Through the Darkest of Times follows the actual events of the Third Reich era, but your actions have a meaningful impact on your life, the life of your group\u2019s members and many people around you.   \nYour members are procedurally generated on each playthrough. They come with different personalities, abilities and views. That makes them more suitable for certain tasks but at the same time more vulnerable. \n\nExperience history. \n\nThrough the Darkest of Times creates a sombre mood. You\u2019ll find out more and more about the cruelty, happening around your group. People disapear without a trace, taken by the official police, sometimes found dead shortly after. There are no good or bad decisions, often you\u2019ll have to choose the lesser of two evils and take the consequences. \n\nYou will always feel the pressure. Have you been watched during your last operation? Can you really trust that new member of your group? Did you do enough to help that family the other day? Dark times need people with the heads held high, no matter what comes. \n\nFeatures: \n\u2022 World War II from a new angle: Resist without fighting\n\u2022 Unique art style, inspired by Weimar Art \n\u2022 Everyday heroes: Your team is made from plumbers, doctors, priests, secretaries or salesmen, not trained fighters\n\u2022 Showing history as it was: As one of the first games ever (in Germany), Through the Darkest of Times received the permission to openly show the Swastika and other symbols of the Nazis to call the enemy by it\u2019s name. \n\u2022 Alternative timeline mode: Could the reign of the Nazis have been ended before 1945?",

        "description": "In this game, we play the role of young scientist Farhad Novruzov, who returned to his homeland to help in filming a documentary movie for an international television channel. Here he faces strange events connected with the ancient religion of Zoroastrianism and the scientist has to find out the reason of these events.\nThe game takes place both from the first person and the third person. Most actions and active research take place in the first person view. The main action of the game takes place in Baku, Azerbaijan. It takes place in an actually existing inner city of Baku. This is the oldest district of the city with a thousand-year history, surrounded by a fortress wall, inside which along with the old streets, there are dozens of historical and archaeological sites.\nThere are several regular enemies in the game, as well as strong enemies (bosses), that were inspired by local legends. In the fight against some of them, there is its own tactic of winning them.\n\nThe game has an extensive encyclopedia and the possibility of research. Articles in a vast encyclopedia, containing articles about historical objects, characters, symbols, etc., are added along the course of the game. In the game there are various items that can be selected, viewed from all sides, learn information about them. With the help of technological glasses, which the main character has, you can read and decipher the inscriptions in the ancient languages that are on the walls of the old city.\n\nSome of the locations are built one-to-one with real city and historical buildings, the game has many objects that reflect the national flavour of the old city.\n\nMost of the game takes place in unusual locations for the genre - a flooded fortress, an ancient palace, ancient ruins, etc. This is one of the rare games in the genre, with elements of horror, where action takes place in a real city, enveloped in a mystical atmosphere.\n\nSurvival mode. Special mode where you can fight with different enemies in various maps. There are three types of survival: try to hold out \"\"waves\"\" of enemies, kill all enemies in a certain time and finally, to last as long as possible, remaining alive.",

Can your relationship survive the night?\n\nUsing a unique narrative choice mechanic, players craft sentences in response to the in-game characters in We should talk. Through this careful choice of words, players express themselves as they discuss ongoing problems about life and romance with their in-game partner over text messages, while also chatting with friends and strangers at their favorite local bar about what\u2019s on their mind. The combination of words they choose impacts the conversations they have, how genuinely they can connect with their partner, and whether their relationship can survive the night.\n",

        "description": "Easy to learn and rewarding to master, Petal Crash is a brand new puzzle game in the tradition of the arcade action puzzlers of the mid-90s. Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage!\n\nEnter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire.\n\nEons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell.\n\nChallenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms! Shoot for high scores in Solo Play, racing the clock or rationing limited moves to get the highest rank you can! Solve puzzling brain-teasers with limited moves in the Puzzle Mode, and make your own puzzles in the Puzzle Editor! Challenge another player or fight the CPU in Versus Mode, racing to make clears and bury your opponent!",

They say it takes seven hours to complete this game\u2026 Well let\u2019s see if you can do it!

        "description": "In Mars Horizon, you take control of a major space agency, leading it from the dawn of the space age through to landing astronauts on Mars. Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now:\n\n\u2022 Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more\n\u2022 Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations\n\u2022 Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System\n\u2022 Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support\n\u2022 Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars\n\u2022 Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft\n\u2022 Create your own custom space agency\n\nYou\u2019re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions.\n\nWill you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet?\n\nUsing actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies?\n\nManagement is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars.\n\nEnter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors.\n\nLaunching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment.\n\nThese are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue?\n\nMars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.",

He's got everything he needs: he's hip, sensitive, and his nose is a different colour to the rest of his face.\n\nLAIR OF THE CLOCKWORK GOD sees you switching between Ben and Dan and using their unique abilities together in an effort to stop all the Apocalypses happening simultaneously, by teaching an old computer about feelings. \n\nSolve classic point-and-click puzzles as Ben to create unique upgrade items for Dan, so he can jump higher, run faster and blast everything away with a shiny new gun. Then, run and jump as Dan to unlock new areas and exciting puzzles for Ben!",

        "description": "The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely... One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the Roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Compendium. \n\nPeace reigns in the small Armorican village, where the villagers go about their daily business. Our two heroes, Asterix and Obelix, hunt wild boar, the blacksmith and the fishmonger quarrel, and the village chief strolls around the village square atop his shield. \n\nAfter a fine day's hunting, Asterix and Obelix return to find their village in flames, pillaged by the Romans! They set off to rescue their fellow villagers, accompanied by their faithful Dogmatix. Their journey will take them to Normandy, Greece Helvetia, Egypt and, finally, Rome, in order to save the villagers from the clutches of the emperor Caesar...\n\nRediscover the first XXL adventure of your favorite Gauls in this fully romastered version!\n\nToggle between Asterix & Obelix et travel accross various regions of the world such as Greece or Egypt to set free Impedimenta, Panacea, Getafix and the other villagers. \n\nFight all the Romans, pirates and Vikings who will stand in your way! Nothing can stop you with magic potion. \n\nCherry on the boar, 4 NEW GAME MODES are available:\n- Course mode for stunt lovers\n- Countdown mode for speed freaks\n- Extreme mode for the bravest Gauls.\n- Retro mode to switch to the original graphics anytime!",

Each level brings new ingredients, appliances and recipes to the table, raising the difficulty level bit-by-bit. \n\u2022 Different foods call for different measures. Earn stars to progress through the game.

Brian will meet all kinds of odd characters, escape from terrible creatures, and unravel the hidden secrets of Sintracorp\u2019s dark past.\n\nDuring Brian's Time at Sintracorp, you will:\n* Familiarize Yourself with Your Workspace: Use the elevator to discover who\u2019s working and what\u2019s lurking on every floor of Sintracorp.\n* Learn Office Protocol: Learn when to chat, when to work, and when to cower in terror from otherworldly beings.\n* Engage in Watercooler Conversation: Investigate your co-workers and discover their sordid, blood-soaked secrets.\n* Consider your five-year goal: Only you can choose how this story will end, so make your decisions carefully!\n* Assess health and safety: Use different light methods to light your path and reveal what is breathing in the dark.\n* Conduct a Rigorous Personal Assessment: Find clues, solve riddles, discover new paths - all without letting the Witch catch you!",

        "description": "Not everything is as it seems in this outlandish puzzle game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.\n\nSpikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.\n\nIt's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.",

        "intro": "In Celebration of Violence is a fantasy action roguelike of exploration and murder.",
        "description": "In Celebration of Violence is a fantasy action roguelike of exploration and murder. The methodical combat requires that you plan your attacks, dodges, blocks, and parries while considering your opponents and the environment. Death is permanent but you can improve your stats and purchase items to aid future lives. And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits.\n\nThe World\nLarge, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit.\n\nElements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area\u2019s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage.\n\nThe shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians.\n\nVariety\nScores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a couple of wooden clubs.\n\nMementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death.\n\nThere are multiple paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters simply offer different starting points, every decision is your own.\n\nChallenge\nNo life is predetermined for success. The cheery graphics disguise a brutal and unyielding experience. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you\u2019re not careful. To reach the end, players will need to demonstrate that they are able to consistently overcome these obstacles. Failure can halt or even reverse progress.\n\nAs you accumulate experience, discover schematics, and defeat bosses you can become permanently better prepared to tackle future challenges. The choices and advantages a player has at the beginning of a playthrough will dramatically increase as they play. New characters, items, and bonuses are unlocked in ways that are only hinted at during gameplay.",

It is the place the villagers of Ravenbrook fear most...\n\nOn this night, a young woman is returning home for her twin sister\u2019s wedding. The sisters haven\u2019t seen each other in years. Yet the invitation was strange, almost as if someone else wrote it, other than her twin.

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone.

In a rural manor, a very long night is about to begin...\n\nExplore the depths of the Azuma Manor, fighting off devilish Yoki, while avoiding traps and solving devious puzzles as you strive to save the Azuma family.\n\nKwaidan mixes classic 3D horror action with point-click adventure to provide a nostalgic-yet-new experience. With no guns, strategy is needed to take on the Yoki close up with traditional weapons such as naginata, magatama and mirror that releases a deadly aura. \n\nAs you explore the grounds of the mansion you can call up a cursor to examine points of interest and discover items that can aid you in your quest. Kwaidan is a unique blend of action-adventure with classic high-wire suspense from beginning to end that will keep you on your toes.\n\nRetro style polygon graphics evoke classic games of the early 2000s, with movie-reel-style presentation. Select between Origin Mode for authentic \"tank-style\" controls, or Modern Mode for standard analog movement and a new subtle cel-shaded look.",

        "description": "*Please note this game is primarily designed for two players*\n\nSimple, competitive, and absolutely loads of fun, BallzOut is the Ball flinging/smashing game you have been waiting for. It's a bit like Lawn Bowls, a bit like Air Hockey and a lot like absolute nonsense. \n\nTake it in turns to roll your Ballz into the scoring zone - do you tactically place your Ballz in an area your opponent cannot reach or attempt to smash their Ballz out of the scoring zone? Tough one.\n\nOver three rounds and with the help of such powers ups as Big Ballz and Sticky Ballz, can you outwit and outmaneuver your opponent to become the BallzOut Champion?   ",

We've got you covered. Just select \"Old School\" or higher from the difficulty menu and you'll be cursing the developers' name in no time.\n\nQuality of Life Improvements!\nFaster respawning (When you die, which will be often, you'll just pop right back out of the Toaster and get on with your day, just like nature intended!), multiple save slots, accessibility options and more mean that anybody can take on the challenge.\n\nSurprises!\nPerhaps you've never played either of these games, perhaps you're new to the sequel, or maybe you have spent years achieving the world speedrun record for both, but whatever your experience with the series, there are plenty of surprises in store for you!\n\nNew Chapter, Completing The Story!\n\"Wait, the game had a story\" You ask?

Different events enforce you to make hard decisions all the time. Whom will you sacrifice: a warrior or a mage? Do you execute or pardon? Spend aether on the repairs or upgrades of weapons? Power is a heavy burden. Will you protect the most sacred, or will you drench it in blood...\n\n Fight, die, fight again!\n\nHuman life is worth nothing where waves of Chaos swamp the shores of Order. It is so easy to die here, and no one worries about tomorrow. No one but you! You are the immortal one. Each reborn is new knowledge. You hone the strategy and save all previous experience, and it will help you endure a little bit longer this time.\n\n The world is huge.\n\nYou start a long and dangerous adventure. There will be dozens of worlds and hostile races, hundreds of unique events, thousands of intertwined destinies and stories ... and you have to take all the risks and make the right choices.\n\n Music \u2014 a powerful magic!\n\nSire, your rule is accompanied by 10 original orchestral soundtracks. Together with music, you are bound to succeed!\n",

        "description": "Enter into a world thick with bubbling psychedelia. Descend deep into a new ecology teeming with multiple pathways, luminous levels, and complex obstacles. Transcend the material realm and assume your true form as Spinch, a hyper-agile organism consumed by the quest to rescue its litter of missing offspring from an endless invasion of misshapen and malformed offbeats and oddities.\n\nBringing back old school difficulty, Spinch will have you replaying sections until you master your timing and reflexes. Dash, dodge, climb, swim, jump, and even shoot your own babies as you take on six enigmatic bosses in six vibrant worlds. Collect items to give you the upperhand while searching for your missing babies. Be on the lookout for your cousin - he's babysitting some of your relatives, but he's a little weird. With only a ticking clock and quick restarts - no lives or game overs - the game is welcoming to players of all experiences, but a formidable challenge to even the most capable of speedrunners.\n\nThe world of Spinch has been crafted and brought to life by talented award-winning Canadian cartoonist, Jesse Jacobs, known for his precise and detailed line work in combination with bold and simple colour palettes. His works contain an affiliation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending of nature with technology. James Kirkpatrick, well known for his participation in the early Canadian graffiti movement and as avant-garde hip-hop artist, Thesis Sahib, created the audio landscape of retro soundbites and electronic sounds found within Spinch.\n\nFeature List\n\u2022 Retro-styled visual wonderland with a psychedelic color explosion by award-winning Canadian cartoonist, Jesse Jacobs\n\u2022 A fine-tuned platformer with tight controls to dash, dodge, and jump off surfaces to survive against neon spiders, massive rainbow worms, and bomb-dropping moondogs\n\u2022 Plunge into the psychedelia of unique worlds ranging from neon plains, to experimental tanks, to frozen icelands, all the way to outerspace!\n\u2022 Face off against kaleidoscopic bosses and shoot them down with your babies as ammunition\n\u2022 Inviting and replayable for everyone; a speedrunning challenge for the insane\n\u2022 Soundtrack by famed Canadian artist, James Kirkpatrick, featuring compositions written on modified Gameboys and circuit-bent, hand-made instruments.",

Find many items to enhance your character and his abilities while you descend down into the Meganoid space ship. Do you rush for the exit, or do you take your time to collect everything there is, barely escaping the security drones that will hunt you down if you linger.\n\nKey features:\n- Levels randomly generated on every game session, based on a set of templates, making the levels unique but familiar at the same time.\n\n- A platformer with \u201croguelike\u201d elements. Consumables, alternate routes, procedural generation, and many devices and gadgets add depth to the challenging gameplay of the original Meganoid\n\n- A lot of collectible items that will change the main character\u2019s abilities to navigate the world. Find a jetpack to start flying around, find anti-gravity-boots to perform double jumps, and much more.\n\n- Hidden bonus area\u2019s to find and unlock. Often providing you with a short-cut or very rare and powerful items.\n\n- A hackable game world. Finding green key-cards allows you to modify how certain elements of the game act and respond to you. Stop rocket-launchers from working, make rockets fly less far, make destroyed robots drop extra lives.\n\nIn true Meganoid tradition, you\u2019ll die a lot in many different ways, but you\u2019ll learn to overcome the difficulties, learn how the Meganoid world operates, and eventually get to the bottom of it!",

The multiple-scenario structure of the previous title returns with an epic new story supervised by IGA (Koji Igarashi) himself.\n\nPlayers take control of Zangetsu, a swordsman from the far east who bears a deep grudge against demonkind and the alchemists who summoned them. Zangetsu must battle his way to the demonic stronghold, but he doesn't have to do it alone! Zangetsu can ally himself with a brand new cast of characters he meets along the way and add them to the playable roster.\n\nThree brand-new playable characters appear in Curse of the Moon 2, including the exorcist Dominique. All characters from the original Curse of the Moon game are playable, too! Each new character adds a variety of gameplay options, abilities, and ways to complete the games' many stages.\n\nPlayers can also create demon hunting duos in 2-player local co-op, available for the first time in the series! Work together with a friend, mix and match the strengths of two different characters, and conquer stages in tons of new and exciting ways.",

        "description": "\"Burst Shooter\" is a fun and creative game developed by one person.\n\nControl this little cute bird to fight against waves of armies of balls.\n\nOnly when the balls hit the edges of the screen will they burst! You can push the balls to the edges with the bullets you shoot or with the bird itself. The more balls burst, the faster you leveling up, the faster the bird upgrades and evolves, and the faster you can shoot! Excitement is guaranteed all the way through!\n\nGame Features:\n\nShooting, bursting, rampaging, unlimited fighting!\n\nBursting a ball through shooting / pushing will increase Health Points. Increased Health will then raise your Energy Level, which will lead to upgrades and evolution of the bird. When a group of balls burst simultaneously, the fun shoots through the roof!\n\nUpgrade as you fight more. Improve your skills with battles. The more you play the more fun it gets! And eventually you will dominate the game!\n\n\u00b7 Try to properly manage your Health Points and Energy Level, and skillfully control the timing for shooting and pushing; You can trade in a portion of your Health Points to cast a Special Move or a Super Move that engulfs a large number of enemies.\n\n\u00b7 More challenging content regularly being released. As the difficulties increase, strategy and hand speed are both essential!",

A manmade island off the coast of Okinawa is humming with a dirty, exotic vibe - and it's awesome!\nRust and faded concrete glisten in the morning sun and the late-night neon, showing off the various faces of the island.\n\n[Amazing Soundtrack]\nLet yourself go to the subtropical sun, the sound of the waves, and the scent of dank weed, and let some real deep cuts and unknown classics of 1990s hiphop take you away. It doesn't matter whether you're chilling on a couch on a rooftop, having a drink at the bar, or capping fools in a firefight in some sketchy alleyway - these dope-ass tracks are gonna get you moving!\n\n[Four \"Kawaii\" Soldiers]\nHey you! Do you like hardcore adventures where you take on the role of an even harder-core badass tasked with beating the crap out of a bunch of demons? Well, so do I, but sometimes it's fun to try out something a little different, you know?\nThese four cute Asian girls couldn't care less about little photo stickers... They'd rather play with some 7.62x39mm rifles and filthy, filthy cash!\n\n[Simple-yet-deep Turn-based Gunfighting]\nUse simple controls to take down evil gang members and killer robots! In New Koza, you can purchase randomly-generated and extremely powerful guns, 24/7.\nLoad up a shotgun so powerful you'd burn yourself to toast if the gas leaked and some brand-new fireproof sneakers, find a group of psychotic yakuza thugs, and personally deliver a handwritten invitation to BEATDOWN TOWN!\n\n[There's a Dog, Too!]\nRuff!",

        "description": "The popular game development simulator which lets you replay gaming history and run your own game development company is finally on Nintendo Switch\u2122. Optimized for both touchscreen and Joy-Con\u2122, Game Dev Tycoon plays better than ever before.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon lets you experience game development history first-hand, from the passionate garage development of the 80s to the AAA studios of today. It\u2019s up to you to hire the best team, create the best games and research the best tech to make your mark on the industry.\n\nCreate games your way: in Game Dev Tycoon, the decisions you make during development matter. Does your game need sharper gameplay, better sound or should you focus more on story and quests? You decide!\n\nGrow your company: once you have a few successful games under your belt you can move into your own office and forge a world-class development team. Hire staff, manage them and unlock exciting new development options. Create your own game engines, invent new technologies and much more.\n\nThink big: with a big fan base and a great team, you can build ever larger games and rake in the profit and praise. But bigger ambition brings new challenges and you will have to manage your team and money well for your company to be among the stars of the industry.\n\nPirate mode: becoming a successful game developer can be tough enough but for an even greater challenge, you can try the (optional) pirate mode in which rampant game piracy makes pleasing your fans while fighting piracy to remain profitable a true balancing act.\n\nCross-platform saves: already a game dev tycoon on other platforms? No problem! Our new cross-platform save feature means you can import your existing game and play wherever it is most convenient for you.",

But in the darkest hour the glimpse of hope, the ray of light appeared, and so it happened: the group of american scientists with Dr. Gusev as their lead scientist invented the special photon cannons, that can easily tear demon flesh apart. New photon weapons were installed on advanced tank models, created by Greenrunner Industries corporation. But there was a problem with tanks \u2014 they can be operated only by those who created it. These people were genius engineers of their time, but when they opposed the government they were imprisoned as war criminals.

All these pesky alien invaders love to attack and capture anything they can reach their hands to. This was earlier, this happens now and believe me it'll happen again in the future.\n \nIn Rusty Gun the aliens are confronted not by some over-muscled macho, fan of bubblegum, not some secret organzation dressed in black, and not even chickenpox. This time the defender of Earth and his own private peace appears to be some casual grouchy old Earthling, who was hurt by aliens that spoiled his favorite fishing leisure by scaring all the fish away. Without any hesitation old man picked up his old and rusty rifle with only one goal \u2014 to show the alien invaders that there idea of having Earth destroyed while he has fishing full on his hands \u2014 the worst possible idea.\n \nExplore the locations infested by alien dirtbags, keep finding secrets and new types of bullets for your rifle. Remember that the whole destiny of mankind is in your hands, and don't forget that you're just old, grumpy and love to kill.",

        "description": "In \"Mad Tower Tycoon\" you have the freedom to build a 100 story skyscraper and include the elements you want to make it succeed; restaurants, cinemas, underground garages or even a zoo. Satisfy potential visitors by choosing the best attractions for your winning plan.  The classic construction gameplay challenges you to gain the coveted \"six-star award\" for your skyscraper. The goal is to complete construction while renting all offices, apartments and shops across a towering 100 floors.\n\nRANDOM EVENTS\nAs well as complaints from expectant tenants you will be dealing with; a fire in the new office, an earthquake shaking your skyscraper and unexpected UFOs kidnaping tenants. The constantly changing pattern of events introduces additional challenges to overcome. These events help keep you motivated and look after the tower, despite everything that it throws at you.      \n\nLEVEL SYSTEM\nDaily missions give you the opportunity to improve your success rate while adding to your experience scores. Learn and progress through a points system to unlock more than 50 skills.\n\nINFORMATION IS THE KEY\nYou\u2019ll need to keep on top of everything; which floors require servicing or where the ambient noise levels are causing customers unnecessary stress. How many visitors came in the last 24 hours? Have I made a profit in the last 30 days? The statistics and filters in \"Mad Tower Tycoon\" will give you a lot of information about the state of your skyscraper.\n\nTHE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAIL\nAvoid your visitors having to climb too many stairs or wait too long for the elevator. No problem: the elevator system in \"Mad Tower Tycoon\" allows you different settings, managing lift waiting times on all floors. It\u2019s a rewarding job, keeping your guests and customers happy and making sure the Tower and your skill sets keep improving.",

        "description": "You got caught smuggling VHS tapes across the border, and now there's hell to pay. You want to find an elusive rare bird in the forest and snap its picture. You have to kill a man in the back room of a shady diner.\n\nThis is Paratopic, an experimental first-person horror game named by Rock, Paper, Shotgun as one of the best games of 2018, and by FACT mag as having one of the top 10 soundtracks of the year.\n\n\u2022 A narrative-driven horror-tinged adventure game that takes you on a journey through a cruel fever dream world.\n\n\u2022 Cut between numerous detailed and varied vignettes to unravel how the stories of three separate characters intersect.\n\n\u2022 Explore the detritus of forbidden industry, kill, drive through the night, find yourself in conversation with some very off-kilter individuals.\n\n\u2022 A leisurely playthrough should take forty-five minutes, give or take, with plenty more to discover in the detailed, grimy low polygon environments. Or speedrun it, if you'd prefer.\n\n\u2022 Over an hour of gorgeous dark ambient music is used to create our subtly dynamic soundscape. An anachronistic blend of modern and outdated production as glitches and textural pads meet synthesis & sampling akin to 1990s Unreal Engine soundtracks.\n\n\u2022 Playable both in TV and handheld mode, experience a critically acclaimed short-form masterpiece at home or on the go. Take the horror with you.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\u201cParatopic sticks with you. It's the kind of game that lingers, haunting the dark corners of your mind after its credits roll. There's something off about it in a delightful way; the atmospheric fever dream of low-poly horror imagery shows, but never tells.\u201d\nDestructoid\n\n\u201cParatopic\u2018s city is a sooty husk, a ruin whose scarce inhabitants eke out day-to-day existence by taking dangerous smuggling jobs, murdering for money, or reconfiguring their flesh in agonized cathode-ray rapture.\u201d\nHeterotopias\n\n\u201cParatopic is a short first-person horror game which draws ideas from Thirty Flights Of Loving but takes them somewhere terrible, leading them down an alley and through an unmarked door into a world which looks a bit like ours but just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nAWARDS\n\nExcellence in Audio Winner 2019\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nNuovo Award Nominee\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nExcellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nThe Best PC Games of 2018 So Far\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nFavourite Games of 2018\nAVClub\n\nThe 10 Best Video Game Soundtracks of 2018\nFACT mag\n\nBest Horror Games of 2018\nBloody Disgusting",

        "description": "Crown Trick is a beautifully animated rogue-like RPG adventure characterized by turn-based combat and skill-item interactive strategy. Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure!\n\nProcedurally Generated Maze\n\nThe procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon. But unlike traditional open maps, Crown Trick locks you inside a small dungeon room to do battle with monsters. Without access to the entire map, you have no choice but to strategically decide how you will mount an attack on the enemy.\n\nSynchronous Turn-Based Strategy\n\nThe game moves as you move, and your enemies will stand still until you decide what\u2019s the best way to attack. Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive.\n\nUse the Environment\n\nAs you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy. Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter.\n\nLearn Skills from your Enemy\n\nThroughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars. By defeating them you will gain access to their abilities, increasing your arsenal of skills you can unleash as you continue on to the next levels.\n\nGame Features:\n\n- A totally new approach to strategy roguelike gameplay\n- Synchronous turn-based combat, where each move is full of possibilities and each battle is a challenge\n- Explore the atmospheric dungeons of different settings and try your best to survive until the end\n- Experience randomly generated dungeons, weapons, relics, items, and challenges each time you start your journey\n- Build your own unique combat style and choose from the variety of 40+ active skills, 60+ passive abilities, 30+ usable items, 170+ special relics\n- Slay 100+ different monsters wielding nine unique types of weapons or up to 120+ individual weapons in total\n- Dare to challenge more than 10+ powerful bosses\n- Solve 60+ mysterious challenges and puzzles\n- Reveal all the secrets and find the truth hidden behind the Nightmare Realm",

        "description": "Here Be Dragons is a satirical turn-based strategy game featuring a unique \"living map\" graphics, where you lead a group of crazed captains.\n\nChristopher Columbus discovered the Americas in 1492. In 10 weeks. With 100 men. With 3 ships. This is a LIE!\n\nFirstly, someone had to defeat Kraken and tritons. Someone had to vanquish the Leviathan. Someone had to banish all the ghost ships. The information about these deeds is missing from the archives, and you can\u2019t find it in any great statesmen\u2019s memoir. The knowledge of the \u201cAvant Armada\u201d was completely erased by some bloody officials.\n\nFeatures:\n- Use the original Dice Activation System to attack enemies, heal your crew, and upgrade the fleet.\n- Collect Ink and use Errata to turn the tide of the encounter.\n- Cross the seas with an ancient, living map, full of terrible creatures that want to devour you!\n- Confront the most fierce beasts that ever lived: leviathans and krakens, predatory whales, and lustful mermaids. Decimate tritons, awake Dagon, and then erase them from human memory.",

        "description": "Ghostrunner is a hardcore FPP slasher packed with lightning-fast action, set in a grim, cyberpunk megastructure. Climb Dharma Tower, humanity\u2019s last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge.\n\nThe streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life.\n\nAs resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction.\n\nAs the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you\u2019re always outnumbered but never outclassed. Slice your enemies with a monomolecular katana, dodge bullets with your superhuman reflexes, and employ a variety of specialized techniques to\nprevail.\n\nOne-hit one-kill mechanics make combat fast and intense. Use your superior mobility (and frequent checkpoints!) to engage in a never-ending dance with death fearlessly.\n\nGhostrunner offers a unique single-player experience: fast-paced, violent combat, and an original setting that blends science fiction with post-apocalyptic themes. It tells the story of a world that has already ended and its inhabitants who fight to survive.",

He soon finds, however, that his other classmates treat him like a social outcast, being the oldest at his school by far. It proves impossible to make friends, and Mitsuki consigns himself to an isolated, lonely existence...\n\nThat is, until he meets the single mother, Himuro Kyouko, who just-so-happens to live in the same apartment complex as him. Mitsuki offers to help Kyouko babysit her daughter, Tama. Kyouko, in turn, helps Mitsuki study for his upcoming exams. Over the course of a year, the two bond \u2014 first, as friends, and then as something more.\n\nFeatures:\n* Around 80,000 word kinetic story (approx 5-6 hours of reading)\n* Detailed background and character art\n* A custom OST\n* Daily messages from Kyouko, the story\u2019s heroine\n* A cute single mother!",

At the base of the turn-based system are not turns, but time. Find and improve new heroes and get coins to buy new spells. But remember, a hero\u2019s death will be fatal.\n\nHeroes\nEvery hero has a special perk and a spell, in addition to the three stats (strength, dexterity, endurance). Gather your team of heroes, come up with unique tactics for battles. Traditional Tank, Healer and Warrior? Or would you only use brute force?\nDuring battles, the pre-selected 20 cards with spells are mixed into the deck. Every 6 seconds of combat you take a new card into your hand. During the normal turn, you will have a choice of actions:\n- Normal attack;\n- Defense;\n- Position change;\n- Casting a hero's spell (one for each);\n- Casting spells from hand\n\nEach spell, be it heroic or from a deck has its own mana cost. \n\nMana is shared by all heroes and accumulates during battle. The player will have to choose which spell to use now, because there may not be enough mana for the next one.\n\nDungeons\nSend your heroes to the most dangerous adventure \u2014 Dungeons of Nexoria. Randomly generated floors with a boss at the end of each. Not everyone will be able to return, but those who can will gain great glory!\n\nEvents\nExploration of dungeons is fraught not only with crowds of enemies that need to be destroyed, but also random events and traps, the outcome of which could be fatal.",

The Mech is most effective against heavy enemies such as tanks, turrets and enemy mechs. However, the light attacks from the droids will damage the mech more, since thy often hit between the armored plating. The Mech has 3 upgrades: Machineguns, Rockets and Armor.\n\nThe Vehicle - your armored vehicle is perfect for running down hordes of droids, It is unarmored so it's not effective against heavy enemies. You can upgrade the vehicle's armor and Nitro which gives you a short but powerful boost in speed and acceleration.\n\nAs you progress in the level you will reach certain areas where the enemies will overwhelm you - fear not! Each attempt earns you coins from the distance you cover and the enemies you eliminate. You will also win different types of prize chests which give you more gold and Parts. Collect enough parts and unlock stronger Mechs and Vehicles.\n\nGet ready soldier and who everyone what you're made of. Transform into the Mech and the Vehicle as the situation demands it and make your way through desert bases, alien jungles and remote lunar facilities and become the ultimate War Titan!",

        "description": "Logic Puzzle Collection is a puzzle game that offers three distinct styles of logic puzzles. In the Sudoku mode, the player is tasked to fill out a 9 x 9 field with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, each column and each 3 x 3 sub-field contains exactly one occurance of each of the numbers 1 to 9. \n\nPermudoku is a variation of the classic Sudoku puzzle, where instead of numbers, colours have to be placed on a 9 x 9 in such a way that each colour appears exactly once in each column, row and 3 x 3 sub-field. However, from the beginning, all fields are already coloured, the player's task is to swap fields around until the colours are distributed correctly. Both game modes include five different degrees of difficulty with 100 puzzles each, for a total of 1000 puzzles. \n\nFinally, in Nonodoku, it is the aim of the player to produce a pixel image using the number hints. The player is presented with a grid of white boxes. Numbers on the side and atop indicate how many boxes need to be coloured black in a row. Each number signifies one continuous line of black boxes, between the black boxes for two successive numbers, at least one space must remain white.",

ART SQOOL will prove that you are.\n\nBut there is no painting without brushes, right? You can collect quite a few new brushes \u2013 although you will have to find them first!

And if so, what will you discover about yourself there, in the dark?\n\nThere is but one enemy...\nBut it is the unbeatable Minotaur. Only by exploring the maze of the Labyrinth can you hope to discover how to defeat this immortal monster. The great maze has many tools, many rewards, and many secrets just waiting for you to find them. But you can\u2019t waste your precious time, for the Minotaur is getting ever closer.\n\nDark Flavour\nThe game is inspired by the Greek myth of the labyrinth and the fight between Theseus and the Minotaur. The dark theme is visually expressed by retro pixel art, enriched by voice acting and metaphorical storytelling, creating (we hope) a thrilling atmosphere.\n\nThe Labyrinth\nThe journey has 6 chapters - each with its own specific challenges, patterns, and rewards. A total of 42 stages, 5 skill upgrades - each with 3 levels, 3 hidden upgrades, 2 unique upgrades, secret passages and Easter eggs. \n\nFair Warning\nThis game is not a rogue-like dungeon crawler, but rather an experience which will ultimately give you the answer to the question: dare you know yourself? Of course, you can simply see it as a guilty pleasure arcade game, just take note: permadeath is unforgiving.",

        "intro": "The largest zombie mop-up operation this world has ever seen is about to start! Mind you heads, zombies!",
        "description": "-Game Description\nZombie's Cool is a growth-type shooting action game in which you have to mop up zombies that frequently pop up in town while searching for the root of the zombie virus.\n\n-Weapon System\n\u25a0 Single Shot Pistol: You can use it limitlessly, but its firepower is weak.\n\u25a0 Machine Gun: The damage dealt per bullet is low, but since its per-second firing speed is high, you can deal a lot of damage within a short time.\n\u25a0 Shotgun: It has a short range, but it deals a lot of damage to multiple enemies.\n\u25a0 Launcher: Along with an explosion, it inflicts physical damage on multiple enemies and also causes flame damage, which zombies can spread to each other.\n\u25a0 Laser Gun: No matter what kind of enemy you're facing, they can be brought down with a single shot from this gun.\n\u25a0 Double-handed Pistols: Shots that hit enemies irregularly bounce of to other areas. If you're lucky, you can bring down multiple foes with a single shot.\n\u25a0 Gunkata: Fire double-handed pistols at random with a cool pose.\n\n-Stage Types\n\u25a0 Normal Stage: All you have to do is wipe out enemies. It's the ideal type of stage for earning coins.\n\u25a0 Death Race Stage: Within a time limit, you have to exterminate zombies on the map with a zombie car.\n\u25a0 Baseball Stage: You have to stop the zombies rushing to home with baseballs.\n\u25a0 Barricade Stage: You have to stop the zombies trying to get through the barricade.\n\u25a0 Escort Stage: You have to escort survivors to the escape point.\n\u25a0 Big Escape Stage: You have to drive a tank to the escape point while defeating the enemies swarming upon you.\n\u25a0 Boss Stage: Zombie's Cool features five bosses who possess varied patterns.\n\n-Coins and Upgrades\nOnce you upgrade your weapons' and the player's abilities, stages you once thought were difficult will be able to be cleared with ease. \nAll upgrade elements within the game are carried out using coins.\nYou can earn more and more coins the higher your combo chain number, which rises as you kill enemies, goes. \nBe careful though, the chain is broken if you are attacked by an enemy or if a set amount of time passes without you killing an enemy.\nThat doesn't sound very easy, you say? Well then, maybe you should try replaying the previous stage a few times to collect some money then upgrade your weapons.\nIf you do that, then at some point, you'll be able to enjoy the experience of having coins gush forth suddenly.\nCoins can solve anything in this game!\nJust be sure to remember to maintain your combo chain by not letting enemies attack you!\n\n-Multiple Round Elements\nSo you've seen the first round ending?\nThen you should try the Normal and Hard difficulties too, where even stronger zombies and bosses are awaiting you.\nThanks to diverse zombies risking life and death to fling themselves at you from an early phase, you'll be able to experience a different feeling then you did when you played the Easy difficulty.\n\n-Enemy Types\n\u25a0 Walker: Moving at a sluggish pace, it's ready to become a good source of coins for the player.\n\u25a0 Rusher: Once it approaches a certain distance, it goes mad chasing after the player.\n\u25a0 Smasher: It's not only great at taking blows, it's also got great attack power and mobility.\n\u25a0 Eater: It's the slowest moving of all the zombie types, but also the strongest against attacks, so it will soak up all the bullets you throw at it like a sponge, leaving you with no ammo left.\n\u25a0 Helldog: It's the weakest against attacks, but it leaps all over the place, making the player busy just keeping up with it.\n\u25a0 Crawler: It crawls around on the ground while shooting out scary acidic spit, requiring a continuous exercise of judgment and control from the player.\n\n-Wait just a second...\nDid you just say you don't think you can handle playing, because of all the different enemies?\nThis isn't the first time I'm telling you this, but when you feel like that, you should discuss things with some coins.\nCoins can solve any problem you'll run into in this game!",

Improve your summoned monsters by fighting alongside them.\n- Death is not the end: Each try gets you closer to the Necromancer. You will lose all your equipped weapons and monsters, but you will retain half the level you achieved in your run.\n- Learn the truth: Discover Tama and Koko's past as you advance through the dungeon.\n- Local co-op play: Use the Flask of Homunculus to create a copy of the playable character and play with a friend in local co-op game.\n\n\n\"Legend says that, deep within these mountains, a heretic decided to violate the will of the gods in order to achieve eternal life.\n\nThe heretic succeeded in this aberrant attempt, and created a tool for forbidden rituals that could grant immortality\u2026 and even bring back the dead.\n\nOver the years and centuries many have tried to get that power for themselves, but all they found in the Necromancer\u2019s crypt was their demise.\n\nThey say that the tool the Necromancer created is also a weapon\u2026\n\nThe Sword of the Necromancer\u201d\n\nTama is a former rogue that is tasked to escort the priestess Koko in her pilgrimage around the continent. During their travel Koko dies, and Tama carries the corpse to the Necromancer's crypt, where legends say there dwells a power that may resurrect the dead.\n\nFilled with despair, Tama will enter the dungeon with the aim of obtaining the forbidden power of necromancy, ignoring the dangers that lurk in the shadows.",

And they\u2019re about to save the world.\n\nIn 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within.\n\nNow everyone\u2019s favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell.\n \nIt\u2019s just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \u201cspinny thing\u201d they do with their eyes.)\n \nWho\u2019s the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam\u2019s nose for detective work, Max\u2019s lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max\u2019s street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.\n\nReturn to the adventure game that was once called \u201cgaming\u2019s first sitcom\u201d and is today known as \u201cthe remaster you didn\u2019t know you were waiting for.\u201d With enhanced graphics, Joy-Con\u2122 and touch screen support, an original jazz score with five new tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN\u2019s Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that will be right at home in your Nintendo Switch\u2122 library.\n",

        "intro": "Team up and pack guns and gear, there is a world to save! Zombies are coming\u2026 and you only have a few men and women ready to fight, lead them!",
        "description": "It has been 11 months since the infection started. Everyone fled the cities, mass panic in the streets. The zombies took over our towns, our buildings, our houses. Now we sleep outside while they roam our streets.\n\nWe waited for the army, and the army didn\u2019t come, so we picked up guns. We waited for a hero, and noone came, so we were left to survive on our own. Now we\u2019re done waiting. Will you lead us in the face of a certain doom?\n\nWe\u2019ve organized into hunting parties, to take our blocks back and push the evil residents away. We officially declare that from today onwards, our city is a Zero Z Zone. We\u2019re the Zombie Blast Crew.\nPlanning and getting the proper crew and equipment is already half the battle. No hero gets through a battle without his sword, and no crew member goes to the field without their gun. Big crowd of walking dead? Karen and her flamethrower got you covered. Need to keep your distance from certain stupid zombies? Michael\u2019s assault rifle or Javier\u2019s machine gun might be a better pick. It\u2019s all about using your head, knowing your craft and picking the right man or woman for the right job.\n\nSame goes for our gear. Do you pack a scout med-kit to heal after-zombie injuries? Some grenades to clear infected areas? Some food to get yourself a hunter survival boost? Don\u2019t rush in, it pays to be prepared. And don\u2019t forget to polish your skills - levelling up will help your gun shooting.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Exciting missions taking place in separate locations of the same city, with different weather and times of the day\n- A team of survivors equipped with unique weapons\n- Individual style of play for each hero\n- Additional equipment that can be upgraded to develop specific skills\n- Several types of zombies, each with a unique movement pattern and a special attacking style, adjust a strategy to your enemies",

        "intro": "Move the world around, not the character! Rotate the levels and let gravity do the rest to solve the puzzles and dominate the leaderboards.",
        "description": "This minimalist puzzler offers a unique premise for an innovative and deep gameplay: here you don\u2019t control your character, but rather the world around it.

There you will meet completely new enemies that will put your strategy to the proof. \n\nNEW UNLOCKABLE: SKILLS\nA new NPC has joined us in the encampment. He has some valuable knowledge to share about new combat techniques.\n\nNEW ITEMS\nWe had 31 in total, and we're adding 21 new ones! Some of our favourites are in this new pool.\nWe hope this is going to add a lot of variety to the runs.\n\nLOCAL CO-OP MODE\nNow you can explore the dungeons with a friend! The Player 2 gets to control the dog while Player 1 controls any of the 4 characters. This is not meant to be a hard challenge, but rather a very joyful two-players experience.\n",

They use sacrifice and oppression to further their goals, often earning the distrust of the other Clans.\n\nStarting Bonus\n\n- Your civilians can go into neutral territory.\n- No Happiness or Production penalty for being wounded.\n- You start with a Sacrificial Pyre. You can build a Dragonkin Altar instead of other military buildings.\n- You start with 2 Thralls. You can buy thralls from your Longship Dock\n\nOppression\n\nOppression is an important aspect of the clan\u2019s economy. Their thralls, like regular civilians, can travel in neutral territory, carry out basic tasks and fight..\nThralls can be purchased from your longship dock and after getting the Capture Lore, you\u2019ll be able to oppress other faction's people.\nBut if by any chance your regular population falls under your Thrall population, they will rise against you!\n\nSacrifices and Dragon Essence Gauge\n\nThe Clan of the Dragon starts each game with an already built exclusive building: the Sacrificial Pyre. You can use this building to sacrifice your people in order to honor the gods and gain their favors, unlocking various bonuses!\n\nDragonkin and their Altar\n\nThe only military camp you\u2019ll be able to build is the Dragonkin Altar where you can create Dragonkins, ferocious military units, that are far more powerful than warriors.    \n",

So why not run a field study and get to know more about this curious political entity? And why not run it in Tropico, which is so famously governed by corrupt politicians (except for El Presidente, of course)? Join the EU in their investigations into 'corruptionomics' and unlock new powerful perks in \u2018Lobbyistico\u2019 for Tropico 6. \nCorruption lies at the heart of the Lobbyistico DLC. Invite faction leaders as lobbyists into the El Presidente Club and conduct backroom politics to unlock a unique new set of perks to boost your economy and manipulate your faction standings. But with increased lobby work comes increased corruption, which will impact on the wider Tropican economy and society. \nFight the spread of corruption - or, let\u2019s be honest, just try to cover everything up - using the new Corruption Agency. Enjoy more new content with two new traits, three new music tracks and a fetching new set of customization items for El Prez and the palace. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 New corruption gameplay mechanic: Use lobby work to gain access to new perks to boost your economy while trying to balance the resulting corruption, which will ruin your island paradise with negative effects if left unchecked.  \n\u2022 3 new buildings: Get some dirty lobbying work done in the El Presidente Club, where statesmen can discuss affairs of state in seclusion and secrecy. Use the Corruption Agency to cover everything up and invite faction leaders to stay at the Official Residence in exchange for political favors. \n\u2022 2 new traits: Polarizing, All For The Folk\n\u2022 3 new tracks: Viva la Corrupci\u00f3n, Fiesta en el Club, Bruselas est\u00e1 Bailando\n\u2022 4 new customization options for El Prez and the palace as well as 3 new sandbox maps\n",

He is armed with a cannon and a sabre, this menace is trouble close or afar.\n\nA new weapon, The Mortar, claimed from The Battlefield, this new weapon will terrify even those cowering behind cover.\n\nA new blessing, Strength, with this, you'll be able to punch down steel doors and land a mean hook on the denizens in your way.",

        "description": "Urban Flow is a game about the subtle beauty of city streets filled with cars moving in perfect harmony. But such order does not happen all by itself - the city needs YOU to control the traffic lights and to make sure everything goes smoothly. That means no crashes, no jams. Everything will run perfectly - as long as you stay focused!\n\nImmerse yourself in a beautiful, hand-crafted, low-poly world to discover the enormous satisfaction of watching the hundreds of tiny, colourful cars flowing through the streets \u2013 all while listening to the chill, urban music.\n\nOver 100 levels, each with its own busy intersection. You have one job: operate the lights and keep it safe.\n\nParty Game (even if you party all alone!)\n-----\n Play by yourself or with friends in scalable drop-in, drop-out local co-op mode for two, three, or four players!\nYou can help your friends or be a little rascal and spread the chaos!\nAvoid accidents by paying close attention to special vehicles and to the other players. Special vehicles include the ambulance, which can\u2019t wait for long, and the tank \u2013 which will plough through anything in its way.\n\nDon\u2019t want to play the campaign?\n-----\n Try our score-based Endless Mode or the Chill Mode - where you play for as long as you want, no rush and no score - only you and the music. Urban Flow is designed to be a great single player experience!\n\nDiscover various environments and weather conditions. Play with touch controls, Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller or Joy-Con\u2122. Complete challenges and unlock rewards.\n\nIn expansion pack for Urban Flow you will find:\n\n\u2022 New \"Challenge\" Mode\n\u2022 20 new levels to explore\n\u2022 new obstacles\n\nBecome one with the flow.

Choose from hundreds of ways of dealing with noisy partygoers, incidentally destroy a drug syndicate, and save the Earth from an alien invasion. May the chickens be with you!\n\n\nYou just want to get some sleep... But it's 3am, and once again your neighbors are having a loud party. You have to finally put an end to it\u2013by any means. \n\nThe craziest party stopping stealth-strategy game is back! Party Hard 2 stays true to its crazy party crashing roots while introducing tons of shiny features:\n\u2022 Dozens of new traps including combos: use different substances that react with each other. Why not set a chain reaction with water and electricity? \n\u2022 4 playable characters with entirely unique play styles, stats, and abilities!\n\u2022 14 sprawling levels featuring 2 boss fights\n\u2022 27-track OST\n\u2022 Brand new crafting system and dozens of items to combine: why not a lighter and a can of gasoline? \n\u2022 Take out multiple targets simultaneously with the powerful Multi-Kill ability!\n\u2022 Scan the room for targets and useful objects using Party Vision!\n\u2022 Interact with NPCs: get an NPC drunk, bribe punks, or make someone pee their pants in fear!\n\u2022 Different objectives that match your playstyle! It's your call if you want to choose only objective-sensitive non-civilian targets. Killing everyone works, too. Your playstyle may effect the progression of the game, specifically unlockables. \n\u2022 Local co-op is back! Stop parties, with a friend! \n\u2022 Brand new 3D visuals and lighting effects\n\u2022 An intriguing story of vengeance and redemption. Yes, with a twist and a fugitive circus bear.\n",

        "description": "Ghostrunner is a hardcore FPP slasher packed with lightning-fast action, set in a grim, cyberpunk megastructure. Climb Dharma Tower, humanity\u2019s last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge.\n\nThe streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life.\n\nAs resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction.\n\nAs the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you\u2019re always outnumbered but never outclassed. Slice your enemies with a monomolecular katana, dodge bullets with your superhuman reflexes, and employ a variety of specialized techniques to\nprevail.\n\nOne-hit one-kill mechanics make combat fast and intense. Use your superior mobility (and frequent checkpoints!) to engage in a never-ending dance with death fearlessly.\n\nGhostrunner offers a unique single-player experience: fast-paced, violent combat, and an original setting that blends science fiction with post-apocalyptic themes. It tells the story of a world that has already ended and its inhabitants who fight to survive.",
